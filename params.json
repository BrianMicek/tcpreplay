{"name":"Tcpreplay","tagline":"Pcap editing and replay tools for *NIX and Windows","body":"# Welcome to Tcpreplay\r\n\r\nThe new home for Tcpreplay is on GitHub!\r\n\r\nLooking for the stable 3.5 branch?  Go here: https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n### Simple directions for Unix users:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure \r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build netmap feature\r\nThis feature will detect netmap capable network drivers on Linux and BSD \r\nsystems. If detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution \r\nduration of tcpreplay and tcpreplay-edit, and network buffers will be \r\nwritten to directly. This will allow you to achieve full line rates on \r\ncommodity network adapters, similar to rates achieved by commercial network \r\ntraffic generators.\r\n\r\nNote that bypassing the network driver will disrupt other applications connected\r\nthrough the test interface. Don't test on the same interface you ssh'ed into.\r\n\r\nDownload latest and install netmap from http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/\r\nIf you extracted netmap into /usr/src/ you can build normally. Otherwise you \r\nwill have to specify the netmap source directory, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --with-netmap=/home/fklassen/git/netmap\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nIf you have a question or think you are experiencing a bug, it is important\r\nthat you provide enough information for us to help you.  Failure to provide\r\nenough information will likely cause your email to be ignored or get an\r\nannoyed reply from the author.\r\n\r\nIf your problem has to do with COMPILING tcpreplay:\r\n* Version of tcpreplay you are trying to compile\r\n* Platform (Red Hat Linux 9 on x86, Solaris 7 on SPARC, OS X on PPC, etc)\r\n* Contents of config.status\r\n* Output from 'make'\r\n* Any additional information you think that would be useful.\r\n\r\nIf your problem has to do with RUNNING tcpreplay or one of the sub-tools:\r\n* Version information (output of -V)\r\n* Command line used (options and arguments)\r\n* Platform (Red Hat Linux 9 on Intel, Solaris 7 on SPARC, etc)\r\n* Make & model of the network card(s) and driver(s) version\r\n* Error message (if available) and/or description of problem\r\n* If possible, attach the pcap file used (compressed with bzip2 or gzip preferred)\r\n* The core dump or backtrace if available\r\n* Detailed description of your problem or what you are trying to accomplish\r\n\r\nNote: The author of tcpreplay primarily uses OS X; hence, if you're reporting\r\nan issue on another platform, it is important that you give very detailed\r\ninformation as I may not be able to reproduce your issue.\r\n\r\nYou are also strongly encouraged to read the extensive documentation (man\r\npages, FAQ, documents in /docs and email list archives) BEFORE posting to the\r\ntcpreplay-users email list:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcpreplay-users\r\n\r\nLastly, please don't email the author directly with your questions.  Doing so\r\nprevents others from potentially helping you and your question/answer from\r\nshowing up in the list archives.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nTcpreplay 3.5 is GPLv3 and includes software developed by the University of\r\nCalifornia, Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and its contributors.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nTcpreplay is authored by Aaron Turner(@synfinatic).
