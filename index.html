<a name="welcome-to-tcpreplay" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-tcpreplay"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Tcpreplay</h1>

<p>Tcpreplay is a suite of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a> licensed tools for UNIX (and Win32 under  Cygwin) operating systems which gives you the ability to use previously captured traffic in  libpcap format to test a variety of network devices. It allows you to classify traffic as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 and 4 headers and finally replay the traffic back onto the network and through other devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and IPS's. Tcpreplay supports both single and dual NIC modes for testing both sniffing and inline devices.</p>

<p>Tcpreplay is used by numerous firewall, IDS, IPS and other networking vendors, enterprises, universities, labs and open source projects. If your organization uses Tcpreplay, please let me know who you are and what you use it for so that I can continue to add features which are useful.</p>

<p>Version 3.5 introduces features that significantly enhances performance. For example, stock Intel 10GigE adapters with <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/%7Eluigi/netmap/">netmap</a> modified drivers and commodity hardware are consistently achieving full wire rates and greater than 100,000 flows/second.</p>

<a name="products" class="anchor" href="#products"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Products</h2>

<p>The Tcpreplay suite includes the following tools:</p>

<h3>
<a name="network-playback-products" class="anchor" href="#network-playback-products"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Network playback products:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>tcpreplay</strong> - replays pcap files at arbitrary speeds onto the network with an option to replay with random IP addresses</li>
<li>
<strong>tcpreplay-edit</strong> - replays pcap files at arbitrary speeds onto the network with numerous options to modify packets packets on the fly</li>
<li>
<strong>tcpliveplay</strong> - replays TCP network traffic stored in a pcap file on live networks in a manner that a remote server will respond to</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="pcap-file-editors" class="anchor" href="#pcap-file-editors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pcap file editors:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>tcpprep</strong> - multi-pass pcap file pre-processor which determines packets as client or server and splits them into creates output files for use by tcpreplay and tcprewrite</li>
<li>
<strong>tcprewrite</strong> - pcap file editor which rewrites TCP/IP and Layer 2 packet headers</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="utilities" class="anchor" href="#utilities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Utilities:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>tcpbridge</strong> - bridge two network segments with the power of tcprewrite</li>
<li>
<strong>tcpcapinfo</strong> - raw pcap file decoder and debugger</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="install-package" class="anchor" href="#install-package"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install package</h2>

<p>Please visit our <a href="https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="install-from-source-code" class="anchor" href="#install-from-source-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install from source code</h2>

<p>Select the <a href="https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/tarball/master">TAR</a> or <a href="https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/zipball/master">ZIP</a> to download. Detailed installation instructions are available in the INSTALL document in the tar ball.</p>

<h3>
<a name="simple-directions-for-unix-users" class="anchor" href="#simple-directions-for-unix-users"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simple directions for Unix users:</h3>

<pre><code>./configure 
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="build-netmap-feature" class="anchor" href="#build-netmap-feature"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build netmap feature</h3>

<p>This feature will detect <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/%7Eluigi/netmap/">netmap</a>
capable network drivers on Linux and BSD 
systems. If detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution 
duration of tcpreplay and tcpreplay-edit, and network buffers will be 
written to directly. This will allow you to achieve full line rates on 
commodity network adapters, similar to rates achieved by commercial network 
traffic generators.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that bypassing the network driver will disrupt other applications connected
through the test interface. Don't test on the same interface you ssh'ed into.</p>

<p>Download latest and install netmap from <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/%7Eluigi/netmap/">http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/</a>
If you extracted netmap into <strong>/usr/src/</strong> or <strong>/usr/local/src</strong> you can build normally. Otherwise you 
will have to specify the netmap source directory, for example:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --with-netmap=/home/fklassen/git/netmap
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Tcpreplay is authored by Aaron Turner(<a href="https://github.com/synfinatic" class="user-mention">@synfinatic</a>). In 2013 Fred Klassen (<a href="https://github.com/fklassen" class="user-mention">@fklassen</a>), Founder and VP Network Technology, <a href="http://appneta.com">AppNeta Inc.</a> added performance features and enhancements, and ultimately took over the maintenance of Tcpreplay.</p>

<p>The source code repository has moved to GitHub. You can get a working copy of the repository by installing <strong>git</strong> and executing:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:appneta/tcpreplay.git
</code></pre>

<p>However you will find that you will not be able to contribute to the Tcpreplay project directly if you
use this method. If you believe that you may someday contribute to the repository, GitHub provides
an innovative approach. Forking the @appneta/tcpreplay repository allows you to work on your own copy of the repository and submit code changes without first asking permission from the authors:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you haven't already done so, get yourself a free <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> ID and visit @appneta/tcpreplay</li>
<li>click the <strong>Fork</strong> button to get your own private copy of the repository</li>
<li>on your build system clone your private repository:</li>
</ul><pre><code>git clone git@github.com:&lt;your ID&gt;/tcpreplay.git
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>we like to keep the <strong>master</strong> branch available for projection ready code so we recommend that you make a branch fore each feature or bug fix</li>
<li>when you are happy with your work, push it to your GitHub repository</li>
<li>on your GitHub repository select your new branch and submit a <strong>Pull Request</strong> to <strong>master</strong>
</li>
<li>optionally monitor the status of your submission <a href="https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/network">here</a>
</li>
</ul><p>We will review and possibly discuss the changes with you through GitHub services. If we accept the submission, it will instantly be applied to the production <strong>master</strong> branch.</p>
